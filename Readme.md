# Lab 26 - Race

## Lab Goal
You will write a program that has two or more players race across the screen using random numbers as inputs.

## Instructions
* You do not need to edit the `RaceRunner` class.
* Complete all of the methods in the `Race` class and the `Player` class.  Use the comments in the files as instructions.
* There are no tests to run for this lab.
* Complete all javadoc comments with the proper tags.

## Possible Enhancements
Feel free to make improvements to the program.  Here are some ideas.

* Modify the way the progress is updated to make the race more exciting.
* Display each player as a single character, rather than a whole line of characters.
* Your own ideas.

## Notes
* The Checkstyle config url is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* Make sure you modify the link at the top of your **Readme.md** to reflect your username if you want the badge at the top to represent the status of your code.

## Grading
* 40 - Player class
* 40 - Race class
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes Checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
